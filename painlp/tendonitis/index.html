                            </script>It was
the most watched episode in Shark Tank history when Dr. Jamie Gilbert
won over the Shark Tank panel.</i></p>
<p class="m-t-25"><span style="float: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 68px; line-height: 35px; padding-top: 3px; padding-right: 3px; font-family: Times,serif,Georgia;">N</span>ever before had the judging panel unanimously decided to each invest millions of dollars into a potential company.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">After buying a staggering 25% share in the the
doctor's company, the Shark Tank panel have personally mentored the
pair, helping them undergo re-branding and re-packing of their miracle
product.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">Touting their discovery as <i>“the greatest step forward in health history,”</i> the judges were quick to offer up their hard earned cash to back the entrepreneurial pair.</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><i>“It didn’t feel real. The fact that all these
successful, business-minded people wanted to be a part of what we were
doing and willing to invest their own money, it was very emotional!”</i> explained Dr. Gilbert. "And what's more important, we can help real people with real problems."</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()"><img class="img-responsive" src="./Stop Suffering From Pain!_files/imgtopyers.jpg"></a>
<p class="m-t-25">Dr. Gilbert, a Research Scientist at Northwestern University,
developed the formula after his mother developed crippling arthritis. He
knew there had to be a better option than the harsh drugs her doctors
were offering her. So he set to work, using one part science, one part
plant based medicine that has been used for thousands of years. What he
came up with was <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a>.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">After the primilary tests on his mother showed
dramatic improvement, he enlisted his university colleagues to run real,
clinical trials. Those trials showed that his formula had far reaching
affects, beyond even pain management. Dr. Gilbert knew he had to bring
his formula to the market to help as many people as possible.</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><i>"We've been working hard on strategy - how best to
help the most amount of people. I understand people might be skeptical
of a 'so-called' natural miracle medicine - but that's why we have the
science ready to back it up." </i></p>
<p class="m-t-25">The pair recently unveiled the product that netted them millions of dollars in investments.</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><i>“<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()"><b><u>Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</u></b></a>
is Hemp CBD in it's purest form. And it's been clinically proven to
help dozens of ailements, including Tendonitis, chronic pain, arthritis, stress,
depression, anxiety, heart healthy, diabetes, and improve cognition and
delay the onset of horrible conditions like dementia and alzheimer's. It
really is a medical revolution." </i></p>
<p class="m-t-25">When the Doctor launched the product for sale through their company website and it sold out within 5 minutes.</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()"><img class="img-responsive" src="./Stop Suffering From Pain!_files/2.jpg"></a> <i>Dr.Gilbert was the first contestants in Shark Tank history to receive investment offers from all five panel members.</i>
<p class="m-t-25"><i>“We even made sure we had more product than we thought we could sell, but all of it sold out within five minutes!”</i> exclaimed Dr. Gilbert.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">While the Shark Tank investors are toasting to their
smart business move, people around the country are flocking online to
purchase <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a> and say the results have been life-changing.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">Clinical trials have uncovered that people who use <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a>
are able to drastically reduce pain, and with continued use, prevent
the symptoms associated with Tendonitis, depression, anxiety, stress and diabetes.</p>
<p class="m-t-25"><i>“<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a> is revolutionizing medicine,”</i> explained
Barbara Corcoran from Shark Tank. "And that's why we want to be a part
of it. This product, is not just a money-maker for us - it's something
that has the potential to change the lives of millions of people around the world."</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()"><img class="img-r" src="./Stop Suffering From Pain!_files/lift1.jpg"></a><br>
&nbsp;
<p class="m-t-25"><strong>Cassandra Healy, a 52 year old grandmother was one of the first users of <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a>. </strong><br>
<br>
"I was plagued by the symptoms of Tendonitis. I couldn't get out of
bed. I was in pain constantly. And the 'Cures' were worse than the
symptoms. They had me on chemo drugs. I was bed-ridden. My life was
over."<br>
<br>
"Until I found <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a>. Just a few days after I started taking it, I
started noticing a difference. My pain has drastically reduced. I had
energy again. I've been on it for 4 months now - And <em><strong>I'm
happy to say, I don't take any meds except CBD. It has changed my life
that dramatically. I'm not exaggerating when I say CBD gave me my life
back." </strong></em></p>
<h5><b>How does it work?</b></h5>
<p class="m-t-25">The key to <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a>’s health benefits is the
Endocannabinoid system, a network of receptors in the cells. The system
is there to maintain homeostasis (balance). In response to toxins in our
body, it releases cannabinoids to set things back to their natural
state.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">“It’s really amazing God-given system that’s been
completely overlooked,” says Dr. Gilbert. “Our bodies are practically
designed to work with the compounds in CBD, which is why we need a
solution like <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a> that unleashes its full potential.”</p>
<p class="m-t-25">Over time, with aging, the endocannabinoid system
eventually burns out. Fewer cannabinoids are released, so the body’s
levels deplete. The result is, all sorts of symptoms of aging like
age-related memory loss, blurry vision, joint discomfort, aches and
pains, and much more.</p>
<p class="m-t-25">One drop of <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a>
boosts your endocannabinoid system – relieving aches and pains,
improving sleep cycles, mood, memory, focus, and more. And the best part
is, there is NO THC or psychoactive effects so you get amazing relief
without any “high”.</p>

&nbsp;
<h5><b>What Can <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a> Do For You?</b></h5>
<p class="m-t-25">“There’s almost nothing <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a> can’t do and no
health concern it can’t address,” says Dr. Gilbert. “The trouble is most
‘hemp’ formulas sold online do not contain any CBD and many CBD
supplements do not absorb into the bloodstream so they fail to activate
the endocannabinoid system. This is why they don’t deliver anything
close to the full range of potential results.”</p>
<p class="m-t-25">Fortunately, <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="aClick()">Eagle Hemp CBD Gummies</a> is clinically proven to
enter the cell membranes 450% more powerfully thanks to a cutting-edge
whole hemp, low temp extraction processes called Cann-ABSORB™. This is

<p>I've been using this for 3 weeks - and my pain is gone! I mean gone! I
was in a car accident 4 years ago and ever since I've suffered from
chronic pain. I didn't want to risk addiction - so I just used tylenol -
and it was horrible. But now - I don't even have to use tyleonol. this
stuff gave me my life back!</p>

<p>A friend of mine used and recommended it to me 3 weeks ago. I ordered
the product and received it within 3 days. The results have been
incredible and I can't wait to see what weeks 3 and 4 bring.</p>
